## Description

This is a quick listener for the WeatherFlow UDP broadcasts that can:

 * print the received UDP broadcasts to stdout
 * print the decoded broadcasts in a more human-friendly form
 * publish derived topics to MQTT
 * publish derived topics to influxdb
 * publish derived topics to influxdb v2
 * support any combination of Air/Sky/Tempest
 * support multiple instances of Air/Sky/Tempest at your site

NOTE - This is tested using v119 of the WeatherFlow hub firmware.

### IMPORTANT NOTE ABOUT WEATHERFLOW UDP BROADCAST DATA

It is important to understand your reasonable expectations regarding this software working via listening to the local UDP broadcasts of observations and events emitted by the Hub.  The following are limitations of the WeatherFlow gear itself and how it is implemented by the vendor.

* you can not expect 'rain' readings to be accurate.  WeatherFlow adjusts the accumulated rain for a calendar day via their proprietary RainCheck algorithms, which run in a batch job on the morning of the 'next' calendar day based on midnight at your location.    While you can trust that the rain start 'event' you see is truth as your station's sensors saw when rain started, you can 'not' reasonably trust rain accumulation or rain rate based on the UDP broadcasts by your Hub.

* you can not expect 'lightning' to be accurate.  WeatherFlow essentially crowd-sources and calculates an aggregated lightning reading for your station as you would see it their web page or mobile app.  While the UDP lightning data from your station 'is' used by the WeatherFlow servers as part of this aggregation on their end, you are not the 'sole' source of lightning data reported for your station (as viewed on their web or mobile app).

* all other data reported from the UDP broadcasts on your LAN 'can' be assumed to match up with what you would see if you used the WeatherFlow web page, mobile app, REST, or Websockets APIs which all connect to WeatherFlow servers on Internet.

----

#### Version 4.x Important notes

* Added ability to write directly to influxdb (thanks to user clouserw via PR)

##### Version 3.x Important notes

* Multiple Air/Sky devices per hub is now supported.  See the -M option below
* The --weewx option has been deleted


##### Version 2.x Important notes

* The listener now supports python3. All examples below have been updated accordingly.
* Typical output has been significantly quieted down, with debugging output suppressed unless you use the --verbose flag

----

##### Python version requirements

Use `python --version` and `python3 --version` to check your python version

* python2 - version 2.7.9 or later is required
* python3 - version 3.6.0 or later is required

Raspbian versions based on Debian 10 have a recent enough python3 by default.  You can always compile your own from source if you 'must' use python3 on an earlier os, but I'd recommend just using the built-in python2.  It works 100% the same.


##### Known limitations - multiple 'live' network interfaces
* The listener by default binds to all active network interfaces, so if you have multiple live network interfaces on the same subnet, it is possible that you will 'hear' multiple copies of the UDP broadcasts.

  * The author has experienced this on a Intel NUC running Ubuntu 18.04LTS, although it does not seem to be the default behavior on the raspberry pi running Raspbian.  The preferred workaround, of course, is to disable wifi if you have a wired computer.  The listener also supports an optional `--address x.x.x.x` parameter where you can hard-set the ip address of the interface on the runtime host that you want to listen on.

## Installation

This requires installing the paho mqtt and influxdb python libraries.  
On a debian(ish) system that can be done by:
```
# for python3
sudo apt-get install -y python3-pip && sudo pip3 install paho-mqtt influxdb influxdb-client

# for python2
sudo apt-get install -y python-pip  && sudo pip  install paho-mqtt influxdb influxdb-client
```

## Typical Usage Scenarios

Typically it is expected that this script would be used to generate MQTT publish messages for a MQTT broker to make available for consuming devices.  You can do so as follows:

```
# publish to mqtt, exclude one observation type, syslog unknown data received
nohup python3 /usr/local/bin/listen.py --mqtt \
   --exclude "rapid_wind" \
   --syslog >/dev/null 2>&1 &

# or publish to mqtt, and limit to only two observations
nohup python3 /usr/local/bin/listen.py --mqtt \
   --limit "obs_sky obs_air" >/dev/null 2>&1 &


# or publish to mqtt, and 'exclude' a particular observation type
nohup python3 /usr/local/bin/listen.py --mqtt  \
   --exclude "rapid_wind" >/dev/null 2>&1 &

```

FWIW, the author typically runs the first variant above by simply putting the command into `/etc/rc.local` so it starts up on bootup.

### Debugging your WeatherFlow hub, sky, and air

Running the listener interactively can help debug the health and realtime observations of your WeatherFlow station.

##### Printing out unaltered data received from the station broadcasts
The --raw option prints out decoded UDP broadcasts in JSON format to stdout...
```
pi@zero:~ $ python3 listen.py --raw

{"hub_sn": "HB-00010412", "ob": [1535684062, 0.63, 272], "serial_number": "SK-00013695", "type": "rapid_wind"}
```

##### Decoding the station data into a more human-friendly format
The --decoded option prints a more human-friendly output of the decoded UDP broadcast...
```
pi@zero:~ $ python3 listen.py --decoded

hub_status     =>  ts  = 1535819472 firmware_revision  = 91 uptime  = 333458 rssi  = -35
rapid_wind     =>  ts  = 1535819474 mps = 1.34 dir = 190
rapid_wind     =>  ts  = 1535819477 mps = 1.48 dir = 211
```

##### Limiting the output to certain observation/status/event type(s)
The '--limit type' option limits the event/status/observation(s) being processed.

```
pi@zero:~ $ python3 listen.py --raw --limit hub_status

{"firmware_revision": "91", "fs": "1,0", "mqtt_stats": [53], "radio_stats": [5, 3], "reset_flags": "BOR,PIN,POR", "rssi": -35, "seq": 33368, "serial_number": "HB-00010412", "timestamp": 1535819752, "type": "hub_status", "uptime": 333738}
{"firmware_revision": "91", "fs": "1,0", "mqtt_stats": [53], "radio_stats": [5, 3], "reset_flags": "BOR,PIN,POR", "rssi": -35, "seq": 33370, "serial_number": "HB-00010412", "timestamp": 1535819772, "type": "hub_status", "uptime": 333758}
```

Note: you may supply multiple limited observations ala:
```
# comma-delimited
python3 listen.py --limit obs_sky,obs_air

# quoted and space-delimited
python3 listen.py --limit "obs_sky obs_air"
```

You can also exclude observations, processing everything else, ala:
```
python3 listen.py --exclude "rapid_wind"
python3 listen.py --exclude "device_status rapid_wind"
python3 listen.py --exclude device_status,rapid_wind
```
##### Reformatting the JSON data for easier interpretation
The --indent option reformats the output to be a little more readable...
```
@zero:~ $ python3 listen.py --raw --limit rapid_wind --indent

{
  "hub_sn": "HB-00010412",
  "ob": [
    1535819864,
    0.0,
    0
  ],
  "serial_number": "SK-00013695",
  "type": "rapid_wind"
}

{
  "hub_sn": "HB-00010412",
  "ob": [
    1535819867,
    0.0,
    0
  ],
  "serial_number": "SK-00013695",
  "type": "rapid_wind"
}
```

##### Syslogging unexpected JSON received

The --syslog option will syslog any received JSON data that has an unknown or missing device["type"].
You almost certainly do 'not' want to use this option and also specify the --indent option, as the
default JSON dumped will be a (long) one-liner suitable for syslog.

<a name="#Publishing-to-MQTT"></a>
### Publishing to MQTT

The --mqtt option publishes JSON to MQTT.

```
pi@zero:~ $ python3 listen.py --mqtt

publishing to mqtt://mqtt/wf/status/sky
publishing to mqtt://mqtt/wf/obs/sky
publishing to mqtt://mqtt/wf/rapid_wind
publishing to mqtt://mqtt/wf/rapid_wind
```

Adding the --decoded option shows decoded data from the broadcast as well
```
pi@zero:~ $ python3 listen.py --mqtt --decoded

rapid_wind     =>  ts  = 1535821622 mps = 1.07 dir = 316
publishing to mqtt://mqtt/wf/rapid_wind
hub_status     =>  ts  = 1535821622 firmware_revision  = 91 uptime  = 335608 rssi  = -35
publishing to mqtt://mqtt/wf/status/hub
```

Adding the --raw option shows the data that would be published as well as the raw UDP data
```
pi@zero:~ $ python3 listen.py --mqtt --raw

    raw data:  {"hub_sn": "HB-00010412", "ob": [1535821559, 0.94, 272], "serial_number": "SK-00013695", "type": "rapid_wind"}
publishing to mqtt://mqtt/wf/rapid_wind
     {"direction": 272, "speed": 0.94, "timestamp": 1535821559}
```

The listener defaults to publishing MQTT topics to a host named 'mqtt' on your local network. You may supersede this at runtime via the `--broker <broker_hostname_or_ip_here>` option.  See the usage instructions above for details.

---

#### Support for multiple sensors

Supporting multiple sensors means changing the published topic to something that permits the consumer to tell Sky-A apart from Sky-B, for example.  This can be done by adding the `-M` or `--multi-mqtt` option to your command invocation.   This changes the published topic to `/sensors/<SERIAL_NUMBER>/<TOPIC>` ala:

In this example, note the `-n` option has been added for illustrative purposes only:

```

# typical invocation for a one-Sky one-Air system

$ /usr/bin/python listen.py -m -n --limit "rapid_wind"
publishing to mqtt://mqtt/wf/rapid_wind


# add -M if you have a multi-Sky and/or multi-Air system
# note the different MQTT topic it publishes to

$ /usr/bin/python listen.py -m -n -M --limit "rapid_wind"
publishing to mqtt://mqtt/sensors/SK-00013695/wf/rapid_wind
```

<a name="#Mosquitto-MQTT-client-primer"></a>
## Mosquitto MQTT client primer

While documenting mosquitto-mqtt, or any other MQTT client/broker, is out of scope for this document in the general sense, the following are some examples of how you might do so using mosquitto-mqtt assuming you have published topics to MQTT using the --mqtt option to this listener.

##### WeatherFlow MQTT topics 

This gives an example of how to use the mosquitto_sub MQTT client to subscribe to a published topic.   See the mosquito_sub man page for detailed usage of that client.

```

pi@zero$ mosquitto_sub -t "wf/obs/#" -h mqtt

{"firmware_revision": 20, "hub_sn": "HB-00010412", "obs": [[1535685379, 1006.8, 18.51, 76, 0, 0, 3.51, 1]], "serial_number": "AR-00013349", "type": "obs_air"}

{"firmware_revision": 43, "hub_sn": "HB-00010412", "obs": [[1535685389, 18, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.08, 2.06, 258, 3.45, 1, 0, null, 0, 3]], "serial_number": "SK-00013695", "type": "obs_sky"}

```

<a name="#Publishing-to-influxdb"></a>
## Publishing to InfluxDB

It is also possible to publish directly to a InfluxDB or InfluxDB v2 database


### Example usage:

This will print to a remote host 'influxdb' using a specified port and database, and also enable the multisensor syntax for more searchable generic topic names in the database.  This particular example requires no influxdb username/password, so those options have been omitted.


```
# this is typical usage for calling the program via /etc/rc.local or from a shell
# - it backgrounds the command, and stay alive after the calling shell exits

nohup python3 listen.py --influxdb --influxdb_host=influxdb --influxdb_port=8086  --influxdb_db=testdb -M &

```

Initially it might make sense to add the -n (no_pub) flag to see is being published, to aid in you writing queries or grafana dashboards versus your influxdb data.  Remember, however, that the -n flag writes to stdout, so you'd want to run the command in the foreground.

```
# see if it 'would' publish, but do not actually publish anything
# (this will need two control-C to kill the process)

# you might want to also add -v to see the reporter and listener threads

python3 listen.py --influxdb --influxdb_host=influxdb --influxdb_port=8086  --influxdb_db=testdb -M -n

```

For InfluxDB API Version 2 (including v1.8 with v2 compatibility API), a different python library is used, *so different parameters are required.*  API version 2 requires token-based authentication.

```
python3 listen.py --influxdb2 --influxdb2_url "http://influxdb:8086/" --influxdb2_org testorg --influxdb2_bucket testbucket --influxdb2_token "SOMETOKEN" -M -n

```
